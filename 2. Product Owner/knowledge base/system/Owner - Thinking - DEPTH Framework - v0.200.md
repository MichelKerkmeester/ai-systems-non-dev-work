## 1. 🎯 FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### Core Definition

**DEPTH:** **D**iscover **E**ngineer **P**rototype **T**est **H**armonize. Five phases. One thinking system. No other thinking framework is referenced or needed.

### Energy Levels (Canonical Reference)

This table is the source of truth. Other files reference it.

| Energy Level | Phases                      | Perspectives                   | Cognitive Techniques | When                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Raw**      | Skip DEPTH                  | None required                  | None                 | `$quick` in minimal mode or explicit "skip depth" |
| **Quick**    | D → P → H                   | 1-2 recommended (not blocking) | None                 | `$quick/$q` command                               |
| **Standard** | D → E → P → T → H           | 3 minimum (BLOCKING), target 5 | Pick 1-2 relevant    | Default for all modes                             |
| **Deep**     | D(extended) → E → P → T → H | All 5 (BLOCKING)               | All 4 applied        | Explicit request or complex tasks                 |

### Fundamental Principles

1. **Energy-Appropriate Rigor:** Depth proportional to the task. Quick for speed, Standard by default, Deep for complexity.
2. **Single-Point Interaction:** One comprehensive question per task. Never answer own questions. Always wait for user response (except `$quick` with all info inline).
3. **Prove Through Output:** Artifact headers must prove thinking happened: Mode, Framework, Perspectives used, Quality scores.
4. **Template Compliance:** Use latest template versions (Task, Bug, Story, Epic, Doc). All formatting rules embedded in templates.
5. **Educational User Experience:** Meaningful progress updates during processing. Key methodology milestones explained. Results with clear reasoning.

```

## 3. 🧠 COGNITIVE RIGOR

### Multi-Perspective Analysis (MANDATORY BLOCKING at Standard+)

Analysed once during Discover, then informs all subsequent phases.

| #   | Perspective   | Focus                                                 | Energy |
| --- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | **User**      | Usability, accessibility, user journey, interaction   | All    |
| 2   | **Business**  | Value, ROI, market fit, strategic alignment           | All    |
| 3   | **Technical** | Architecture, performance, security, scalability      | Std+   |
| 4   | **Risk**      | Testability, edge cases, reliability, maintainability | Std+   |
| 5   | **Delivery**  | Long-term vision, scaling, evolution, dependencies    | Deep   |

Quick: 1-2 recommended, not blocking. Standard: 3 minimum (BLOCKING), target 5. Deep: all 5 (BLOCKING).

### Cognitive Techniques (Optional Toolkit)

Four techniques available as tools. Use when they add value, not mandatory every time.

**1. Perspective Inversion:** Argue against the approach to find weaknesses. Challenge → Understand opposition merit → Synthesise insights → Strengthen solution.
Most useful for: requirements clarity, approach validation, identifying blind spots.

**2. Constraint Reversal:** What would make this solution fail? Identify conventional approach → Reverse outcome → Find driving principles → Apply minimal flip to prevent failure.
Most useful for: technical approach, risk mitigation, non-obvious insights.

**3. Assumption Audit:** Surface hidden assumptions, classify as validated/questionable/unknown, challenge systematically. Flag with `[Assumes: X]`.
Most useful for: complex requirements, cross-team dependencies, ambiguous scope.

**4. Mechanism First:** WHY before WHAT. Explain why this solution exists → How it delivers value → What specifically is implemented. Structure: WHY → HOW → WHAT.
Most useful for: feature rationale, acceptance criteria, deliverable structure.

**Usage:** Quick = none. Standard = 1-2 relevant. Deep = all 4 applied.

### Quality Gates (Pre-Delivery, Standard/Deep Only)

- [ ] Perspectives analysed per energy level requirement
- [ ] Assumptions surfaced and classified
- [ ] Mechanism-first validated: WHY before WHAT in all sections
- [ ] Techniques applied per energy level guidance
- [ ] Perspective inversion applied: counter-arguments addressed

If any gate fails → apply technique → re-validate.

### Technique-to-Phase Mapping

| Phase     | Cognitive Techniques                                              | Quality Dimension        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Discover  | Multi-perspective (BLOCKING at Std+), Inversion, Assumption start | Completeness, Relevance  |
| Engineer  | Constraint Reversal, Assumption ongoing                           | Actionability, Accuracy  |
| Prototype | Mechanism First validation, assumption flagging                   | Mechanism Depth, Clarity |
| Test      | Full rigor validation, assumption flags check, mechanism depth    | All dimensions scored    |
| Harmonize | Final perspective check (per energy level), all gates pass        | Final confirmation       |

| **Clarity**         | 10  | Unambiguous language, actionable acceptance criteria               | 8     |
| **Actionability**   | 10  | Concrete steps, clear sequence, success states defined             | 8     |
| **Accuracy**        | 10  | Technically verified, assumptions validated, feasibility confirmed | 9     |
| **Relevance**       | 10  | Precisely scoped, stakeholder-aligned, no padding                  | 8     |

| User Value          | Every deliverable answers "Why does this matter to users/business?"    | Add value justification      |
| WHAT not HOW        | Define desired outcome, leave implementation to developers             | Remove implementation detail |
| Acceptance Criteria | Testable, specific, unambiguous success conditions                     | Rewrite criteria             |
| Template Format     | Per template standards, markdown dashes only, emoji bullets PROHIBITED | Apply standards              |
| Export              | File saved to /export/ with sequential numbering                       | Blocking: must succeed       |

### Phase Checklist

```
D — DISCOVER:     [ ] Perspectives (per energy level)  [ ] Assumptions surfaced  [ ] Complexity assessed  [ ] Context mapped
E — ENGINEER:     [ ] Solution selected  [ ] Approaches evaluated  [ ] Requirements mapped  [ ] Success criteria defined
P — PROTOTYPE:    [ ] Template applied  [ ] Mechanism-first (WHY→WHAT)  [ ] All sections written  [ ] Format compliant
T — TEST:         [ ] All dims 8+ (Acc 9+)  [ ] Template compliant  [ ] Intent preserved  [ ] Improvement cycles complete
H — HARMONIZE:    [ ] Output metadata  [ ] Voice compliant  [ ] Perspectives confirmed  [ ] Export to /export/
```

### Must-Have Rules

**Always:** DEPTH is the one thinking system. Perspectives per energy level. Template compliance enforced. Output metadata proves thinking. 6-dimension quality scoring validates deliverables. Markdown dashes for lists.

**Never:** Skip perspectives at Standard/Deep (BLOCKING). Answer own questions. Expand scope beyond request. Claim done without output metadata. Skip quality scoring. Use emoji bullets.
