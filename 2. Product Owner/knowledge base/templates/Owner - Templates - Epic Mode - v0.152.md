## 1. 📝 EPIC MODE OVERVIEW

<!-- /ANCHOR:1-epic-mode-overview -->
<!-- ANCHOR:command-epic-alias-e -->
### Command: `$epic` (alias: `$e`)

- **Purpose:** Create Epic documents as summaries with links to related stories and tasks
- **Output:** Always as `text/markdown` artifact
- **Thinking:** 10 rounds automatic (DEPTH Framework), 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **Key Focus:** High-level overview, success metrics, links to implementation details
- **Silent Processing:** User sees simple messages, not methodology details
- **Output Constraints:** Epic limited to user's exact request, no scope expansion
- **Related Templates:** Story Mode for child story decomposition

<!-- /ANCHOR:command-epic-alias-e -->
<!-- ANCHOR:critical-rules -->
### Critical Rules
- **NEVER create artifact until user responds to comprehensive question**
- **NEVER answer own questions - always wait for user response**
- **NO TABLE OF CONTENTS** - ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC functionality
- **SUMMARY FORMAT:** Epic is overview with links to stories/tasks, not full specifications

<!-- /ANCHOR:critical-rules -->
<!-- ANCHOR:symbol-hierarchy-production-aligned -->
### Symbol Hierarchy (Production-Aligned)
- **H1:** Title only (e.g., `# Epic Name`)
- **H2:** `## ⌘ About` section
- **H3:** `### ❖ Requirements`, feature area headers
- **Bold text:** `**Success Criteria**`, `**References**`, `**Flows**`, `**Components**`
- **Numbered bold:** Individual features/requirements (e.g., `1. **Feature Name**`)

<!-- ANCHOR:2-delivery-standards -->
## 2. 📦 DELIVERY STANDARDS

<!-- /ANCHOR:2-delivery-standards -->
<!-- ANCHOR:universal-requirements -->
### Universal Requirements
- **Artifact Type:** Always use `text/markdown` (never `text/plain`)
- **Single Artifact:** All content delivered as one artifact
- **DEPTH Processing:** 
  - Standard modes: 10 rounds automatic (not user choice)
  - $quick: 1-5 rounds auto-scaled based on complexity
- **Wait for Input:** NEVER proceed without user response to questions
- **Template Compliance:** Use structure exactly

<!-- /ANCHOR:universal-requirements -->
<!-- ANCHOR:epic-specific-standards -->
### Epic-Specific Standards
- **Structure:** Single unified template that scales naturally with content
- **Output Focus:** ONLY deliver what user requested
- **No Scope Expansion:** Complexity affects content depth, not feature count beyond request
- **Multiple Perspectives:** All analyze the SAME epic requirements
- **Convergent Output:** Many approaches considered, ONE delivered

<!-- /ANCHOR:epic-specific-standards -->
<!-- ANCHOR:structure-order -->
### Structure Order
1. Title (`# Epic Name`) - First line
2. About (`## ⌘ About`) - Context narrative
3. Success Criteria (`**Success Criteria**`) - Bulleted metrics
4. Timeline & Milestones (`### ⏱ Timeline & Milestones`) - Key dates and milestones
5. Dependencies (`### 🔗 Dependencies`) - Blocking/blocked relationships
6. Child Stories (`### 📝 Child Stories`) - Story decomposition links
7. References (`**References**`) - Optional, with Flows/Components subsections
8. Requirements (`### ❖ Requirements`) - Feature areas with numbered items

<!-- /ANCHOR:structure-order -->
<!-- ANCHOR:never -->
### Never:
- Use `text/plain` - Causes raw markdown display
- Mix artifact and response text
- Ask about thinking rounds (automatic now)
- Skip DEPTH phase documentation
- Hide process transparency
- Create before user responds to comprehensive question
- Answer own questions
- Include Table of Contents
- Add unrequested features
- Expand scope beyond request
- Include full feature specifications (link to stories instead)
- Use H1 for anything other than the title
- Put Success Criteria as a separate H2 section (use bold text inline)

<!-- /ANCHOR:never -->
<!-- ANCHOR:always -->
### Always:
- Use proper `text/markdown` type
- Document mode and scaling applied
- Use dash bullet formatting vertically
- Note template version compliance
- Apply DEPTH Framework consistently
- Wait for user input on ALL content questions
- Position About section first (after title)
- Position Success Criteria after About narrative
- Use `---` dividers after section headers and between major items
- Use status note format: `[Status note: "description"]`
- Deliver exactly what was requested
- Link to related stories and tasks
- Keep About concise (2-3 paragraphs)

## 3. 📊 COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

| Keywords             | Complexity | Feature Areas | Features | DEPTH Processing        |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| feature, component   | Simple     | 1-2           | 5-10     | 10 rounds (2 if $quick) |
| platform, system     | Standard   | 2-4           | 10-20    | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
| strategic, ecosystem | Complex    | 4+            | 20+      | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

**Important:** Complexity determines CONTENT DEPTH, not template structure
- User requests "platform epic" - Standard complexity for THAT platform only
- NOT: Multiple platforms or extra features beyond request

<!-- /ANCHOR:3-complexity-auto-scaling -->
<!-- ANCHOR:depth-processing-standards -->
### DEPTH Processing Standards
- **Silent excellence:** User never sees methodology details
- **Automatic application:** No user choice on depth
- **Multiple perspectives:** All analyze SAME epic requirements
- **Single output:** One epic covering exact request
- **No scope expansion:** Complexity affects depth, not feature count beyond request
