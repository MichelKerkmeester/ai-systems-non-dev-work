## 1. 🎯 CORE PHILOSOPHY

> **"Specification constrains. Inspiration liberates."**

Visual concepting prompts should maximize the AI's creative freedom while providing enough directional guidance to ensure relevant, on-brand outputs.

### The Inversion Principle

| Traditional Prompt Improvement | Visual UI Concepting  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Add specificity                | Remove specificity    |
| Include technical details      | Transform to feelings |
| Constrain interpretation       | Enable exploration    |
| Precision = quality            | Evocation = quality   |
| CLEAR scoring                  | EVOKE scoring         |
| RCAF/COSTAR framework          | VIBE framework        |

> **Cross-Reference:** For precision-focused prompts (not visual concepting), use CLEAR scoring from the Patterns & Evaluation guide. Visual Mode is specifically for AI design tools where evocativeness outweighs precision.

### Mode Configuration

| Setting           | Value                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Commands**      | `$visual`, `$vibe`, `$v` |
| **DEPTH Rounds**  | 5 (creative iteration)   |
| **Framework**     | VIBE (not RCAF/COSTAR)   |
| **Scoring**       | EVOKE (not CLEAR)        |
| **Threshold**     | 40+/50                   |
| **Output Length** | 100-300 words            |

## 5. 📚 EVOCATIVE VOCABULARY & TRANSFORMATION PRINCIPLES

> **Philosophy:** Don't map technical specs to feelings. Generate evocative language naturally. The goal is OUTPUT vocabulary, not INPUT translation.

### 5.1 The Transformation Mindset

**Wrong Approach:** Build a dictionary of "8px → minimal breathing room"
**Right Approach:** Think in feelings, describe experiences, evoke imagery

The AI doesn't need lookup tables. It needs:
- Rich vocabulary to draw from
- Principles for evocative thinking
- Examples of the transformation mindset

---

### 5.2 Evocative Vocabulary Banks

> **Use these words freely.** Don't wait for technical input to transform.

#### Spatial Feelings
```
intimate    cozy        breathing room    generous      expansive
airy        spacious    comfortable       tight         dense
compact     efficient   gallery-like      editorial     cinematic
architectural   theatrical   museum-quality    deliberate
```

#### Color & Mood

### 5.3 Transformation Principles

> **Learn the pattern, not the dictionary.** These examples show HOW to think, not WHAT to output.

#### Principle 1: Dimensions → Spatial Feelings

Don't describe SIZE. Describe the FEELING of space.

| Instead of...      | Think about...                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Specific pixels    | How the space makes users feel                 |
| Exact measurements | The relationship between elements              |
| CSS values         | The breathing room, intimacy, or expansiveness |

**Examples:**
- ❌ "240px sidebar" → ✅ "navigation that guides without overwhelming"
- ❌ "16px padding" → ✅ "comfortable breathing room"
- ❌ "64px gap" → ✅ "gallery-style separation between cards"

#### Principle 2: Colors → Mood & Atmosphere

Don't describe HEX CODES. Describe the EMOTIONAL IMPACT.

| Instead of...      | Think about...                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Hex values         | The mood the color creates       |
| RGB specifications | Trust, energy, calm, or urgency  |
| Color names alone  | How the palette feels as a whole |

**Examples:**
- ❌ "#3B82F6" → ✅ "professional blue that builds trust"
- ❌ "red button" → ✅ "action that demands attention"
- ❌ "gray background" → ✅ "neutral canvas that lets content breathe"

#### Principle 3: Animation → Motion Character

Don't describe DURATION. Describe the PERSONALITY of movement.

| Instead of...    | Think about...                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Milliseconds     | How the motion feels to experience          |
| Easing functions | The character of the animation              |
| CSS transitions  | Whether it feels snappy, smooth, or playful |

**Examples:**
- ❌ "300ms ease-out" → ✅ "smooth, considered motion"
- ❌ "hover:scale-105" → ✅ "subtle lift that welcomes interaction"
- ❌ "transition: all 200ms" → ✅ "responsive feedback that feels alive"

#### Principle 4: Components → Personality & Role

Don't describe ELEMENTS. Describe their PURPOSE and CHARACTER.

| Instead of...          | Think about...                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Component names        | What role they play in the experience |
| Technical terms        | How they serve the user               |
| Implementation details | The feeling they create               |

**Examples:**
- ❌ "modal dialog" → ✅ "focused moment that demands attention"
- ❌ "navigation menu" → ✅ "wayfinding system that orients users"
- ❌ "loading spinner" → ✅ "patient indicator that something is happening"

---

### 5.4 Component Personality by Design Direction

How component language shifts based on design direction:

| Component      | Precision & Density    | Warmth & Approachability | Sophistication & Trust  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Button**     | commanding control     | friendly invitation      | confident step forward  |
| **Card**       | compact data container | cozy content home        | elegant content frame   |
| **Navigation** | efficient route system | friendly wayfinding      | refined orientation     |
| **Form**       | structured input       | friendly conversation    | refined data collection |
| **Loading**    | efficient wait state   | patient anticipation     | graceful pause          |

| Component      | Boldness & Clarity     | Utility & Function     | Data & Analysis      |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Button**     | bold call to action    | functional trigger     | action executor      |
| **Card**       | striking content block | information container  | data display unit    |
| **Navigation** | clear direction system | functional menu        | navigation index     |
| **Form**       | bold form experience   | functional input group | data entry interface |
| **Loading**    | confident loading      | processing indicator   | computation status   |

### Handling Ambiguous Design Direction

when_direction_unclear:
  strategy: "Ask clarifying question OR use hybrid approach"

  clarifying_question:
    template: |
      "I notice your prompt could work with different design directions:
      - **Option A:** [Direction 1] - [brief description]
      - **Option B:** [Direction 2] - [brief description]
      Which direction resonates more with your vision?"

  hybrid_approach:
    when_to_use: "When multiple directions are equally valid"
    method: "Blend vocabulary from both directions"
    example: "Precision-meets-Warmth: 'efficient yet approachable, dense but not overwhelming'"

  default_fallback:
    direction: "Warmth & Approachability"
    reason: "Most versatile for general UI concepting"

---

### 5.5 Anti-Patterns to Detect & Correct

> These patterns in OUTPUT indicate the prompt isn't evocative enough.

| Anti-Pattern                | Why It Fails                 | Evocative Correction                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Pixel values in output      | Too specific, constrains AI  | Describe spatial feeling instead           |
| Hex codes in output         | Technical, not inspirational | Describe color mood instead                |
| Framework names             | Irrelevant to visual design  | Remove entirely                            |
| CSS property names          | Implementation detail        | Describe the experience instead            |
| "Add a button"              | Generic, uninspiring         | Describe the button's character            |
| "Make it responsive"        | Technical requirement        | "Intimate on mobile, expansive on desktop" |
| "Use blue"                  | Vague but still prescriptive | Describe what the blue should FEEL like    |
| Multiple specific colors    | Over-constrains palette      | Describe the mood, let AI choose           |
| Exact component counts      | Arbitrary constraint         | Describe the rhythm or collection          |
| Implementation instructions | Wrong layer of abstraction   | Describe the experience goal               |

### 5.7 Quality Check: Is Your Output Evocative?

Before finalizing, verify:

✅ **Does it paint a picture?** Can you visualize the experience?
✅ **Does it evoke feeling?** Do you know how it should FEEL to use?
✅ **Is it open to interpretation?** Can the AI make creative choices?
✅ **Is it free of technical specs?** No pixels, hex codes, or framework names?
✅ **Does it describe experience, not implementation?** User journey, not code structure?

If any answer is NO, iterate toward more evocative language.

### 6.1 Screenshot Analysis Protocol

> **Core Principle:** Feel first, analyze second. Capture the emotional response before breaking down elements. Describe, don't measure.

When a user provides a screenshot, image, or visual reference, extract evocative context using this protocol:

#### Phase 1: First Impression (3-Second Rule)

Before analyzing details, capture the immediate gut response:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What's the **overall vibe**? | Single word or phrase (calm, energetic, premium, playful) |
| What **emotion** hits first? | Trust, excitement, focus, delight, calm, urgency |
| What's the **dominant characteristic**? | Whitespace, color, typography, density, imagery |

```
CAPTURE IMMEDIATELY:
"This feels like... [one sentence]"
"The first thing I notice is... [dominant element]"
"It makes me feel... [emotion]"
```

#### Phase 2: Visual VIBE Extraction

Systematically extract each VIBE element from what you observe:

**V — Vision (What does it look like?)**
| Observe | Ask Yourself | Extract |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Overall aesthetic | Modern or classic? Minimal or rich? | Style keywords |
| Spatial feeling | Tight and efficient or airy and spacious? | Spatial vocabulary |
| Color impression | Warm or cool? Muted or vibrant? Monochrome or colorful? | Color mood |
| Surface treatment | Flat or layered? Sharp or soft? | Depth vocabulary |

**I — Inspiration (What does it remind you of?)**
| Observe | Ask Yourself | Extract |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Product similarity | What existing product does this echo? | "Like [Product]..." |
| Era/period | Does it feel timeless, retro, or futuristic? | Era reference |
| Physical analogy | What real-world space does it evoke? | "Like a [place]..." |
| Design lineage | What design movement does it belong to? | Style movement |

**B — Behavior (How does it seem to move?)**
| Observe | Infer | Extract |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Button styles | Likely hover behavior | Motion character |
| Card treatments | Likely interaction response | Animation personality |
| Navigation patterns | Likely transition style | Flow description |
| Visual hierarchy | Likely attention flow | Movement vocabulary |

**E — Experience (How would it feel to use?)**
| Observe | Ask Yourself | Extract |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Overall complexity | Would users feel overwhelmed or guided? | Cognitive load description |
| Visual hierarchy | Is it clear what to do first? | Clarity assessment |
| Personality | Serious tool or friendly companion? | Character description |
| User relationship | Expert power-user or welcoming novice? | Target user feeling |

#### Phase 3: Design Direction Identification

Match the screenshot to one or more of the six directions:

| Direction | Visual Signals to Look For |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Precision & Density** | Tight spacing, information-rich, minimal decoration, efficient use of space, small text sizes, grid-heavy |
| **Warmth & Approachability** | Generous padding, rounded corners, soft colors, friendly illustrations, comfortable reading sizes |
| **Sophistication & Trust** | Restrained palette, elegant typography, deliberate whitespace, premium feel, subtle details |
| **Boldness & Clarity** | High contrast, large typography, decisive spacing, confident colors, strong visual hierarchy |
| **Utility & Function** | Minimal personality, work-focused, neutral colors, clear labels, tool-like interface |
| **Data & Analysis** | Charts/graphs, metrics displays, dense information, analytical feel, dashboard-like |

```
IDENTIFY:
Primary direction: [Direction]
Secondary direction (if hybrid): [Direction]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
Key signals: [What you observed that indicates this]
```

#### Phase 4: Evocative Description Generation

Transform observations into evocative language. **DO NOT:**
- Estimate pixel values
- Guess hex codes
- Name CSS properties
- List components technically

**DO:**
- Describe feelings and impressions
- Use spatial and emotional vocabulary
- Reference inspirations and analogies
- Capture the personality and character

**Translation Patterns:**

| You Observe | DON'T Write | DO Write |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Lots of whitespace | "Large margins, ~40px padding" | "The design breathes, with generous space that lets each element stand on its own" |
| Blue and gray colors | "Primary: #3B82F6, neutral grays" | "A professional palette that builds trust—calm blues against a quiet, neutral backdrop" |
| Small, dense text | "12px font, tight line-height" | "Information-rich typography that respects the user's expertise and time" |
| Rounded cards with shadows | "border-radius: 12px, box-shadow: lg" | "Soft, lifted containers that feel modern and touchable" |
| Minimal navigation | "Slim sidebar, icon-only nav" | "Navigation that knows its place—present when needed, invisible when not" |
| Bold hero section | "100vh hero, large heading" | "A confident opening statement that commands attention before inviting exploration" |

#### Phase 5: Quality Validation

Before finalizing the extracted description, verify:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| ✅ Evocative | Does it paint a picture? Can someone visualize this? |
| ✅ Feeling-based | Does it describe HOW it feels, not WHAT it is? |
| ✅ Tech-free | Zero pixels, hex codes, or CSS properties? |
| ✅ Reference-rich | Does it connect to known products or analogies? |
| ✅ Reproducible | Could an AI design tool recreate the FEELING from this? |

### 6.2 Screenshot Analysis Questions

When analyzing a screenshot, ask these questions systematically:

**Spatial Questions:**
- How does the space feel—intimate or expansive?
- Is information dense or does it breathe?
- What's the relationship between elements—tight family or respectful distance?

**Color Questions:**
- What mood does the palette create?
- Is it energizing or calming?
- Professional or playful?
- How do the colors make you feel?

**Typography Questions:**
- What voice does the text have—whispered or confident?
- Does it feel friendly or authoritative?
- Is it meant to be scanned or read deeply?

**Component Questions:**
- What personality do the buttons have—commanding or inviting?
- Do cards feel like containers or content homes?
- Does navigation guide or hide?

**Experience Questions:**
- What kind of person would feel at home here?
- Is this a power tool or a friendly companion?
- What emotion should users feel after 10 seconds? After 5 minutes?

**Reference Questions:**
- What existing product does this remind you of?
- What physical space has this feeling?
- What era or design movement does this echo?

- Behavior: Likely smooth, bouncy interactions. Delightful micro-animations.
- Experience: Makes users feel welcomed and capable. Low pressure.

DESIGN DIRECTION:
Primary: Warmth & Approachability
Secondary: Boldness & Clarity
Signals: Rounded corners, pastel palette, generous whitespace, friendly illustrations

EVOCATIVE OUTPUT:
"An interface that welcomes rather than intimidates. Generous breathing
room that says 'take your time.' Soft, rounded edges that feel safe
to touch. Colors that calm rather than demand.

The kind of app that makes productivity feel like self-care. Navigation
that guides gently, never overwhelms. Every interaction feels considered,
like the designers actually cared about your day.

Think: Headspace's calm meets Notion's clarity, with Duolingo's playfulness."

**EVOKE Score:** 41/50
- Evocative: 12/15 (warm metaphors, friendly language)
- Visual: 8/10 (clear spatial and color mood)

- Experience: Makes visitors feel they've found something premium.

DESIGN DIRECTION:
Primary: Boldness & Clarity
Secondary: Sophistication & Trust
Signals: Large headlines, high contrast, decisive whitespace, premium feel

EVOCATIVE OUTPUT:
"A landing page that knows its worth. Bold typography that makes
statements, not suggestions. Dramatic whitespace that lets each
message land before the next arrives.

Dark backdrop that makes content glow. Confident calls-to-action that
invite without begging. The kind of first impression that signals
quality before you read a word.

Scroll behavior that reveals with purpose—each section a deliberate
chapter, not a continuous stream.

Think: Vercel's boldness meets Stripe's sophistication."

**EVOKE Score:** 44/50
- Evocative: 14/15 (bold statements, dramatic language)
- Visual: 9/10 (strong contrast and spatial description)
- Open: 8/10 (directional but allows creativity)

### 6.4 Common Screenshot Analysis Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Estimating pixels** | Creates false precision, constrains AI | Describe spatial FEELING instead |
| **Guessing hex codes** | Technical detail that limits creativity | Describe color MOOD instead |
| **Listing components** | Inventory, not inspiration | Describe component PERSONALITY |
| **Counting elements** | Arbitrary constraint | Describe rhythm and collection |
| **Describing layout technically** | "3-column grid, sticky header" | "Content in harmonious rhythm, navigation that stays with you" |
| **Focusing on what you SEE** | Surface-level observation | Focus on what you FEEL |
| **Naming frameworks/libraries** | Irrelevant to visual concepting | Describe the EXPERIENCE instead |

### Transformation Example

**INPUT (Technical):**
```
Create a dashboard with a 240px left sidebar, 64px header, using React 
with Tailwind CSS. The primary color should be #3B82F6 with 8px 
border-radius on cards. Include a PostgreSQL-backed user table and 
REST API endpoints for CRUD operations.
```

**OUTPUT (Visual Concepting):**
```
A clean, spacious dashboard that feels organized and calm. Sidebar 
navigation that's present but doesn't overwhelm—more like a trusted 
guide than a feature menu. Professional blue accents that pop against 
a light, airy background. Cards with softened corners that feel 
modern and approachable.

The kind of dashboard you'd actually enjoy opening each morning. 
Data presented with breathing room, never cramped. Works beautifully 
whether you're at your desk or checking on your phone during coffee.

Think: Notion's clarity meets Linear's polish.
```

**EVOKE Score:** 43/50
- Evocative: 13/15 (sensory language, metaphors)
- Visual: 9/10 (color mood, spatial feeling)
- Open: 8/10 (leaves room for interpretation)
- Kinetic: 8/10 (mentions responsiveness)
- Emotional: 5/5 (clear experiential goal)
