# Prompt - Patterns, Enhancements & Evaluation

Comprehensive framework library, enhancement patterns, and CLEAR evaluation methodology for systematic prompt engineering excellence.

**Loading Condition:** TRIGGER
**Purpose:** Provides the complete knowledge base for prompt engineering excellence through framework selection, systematic enhancement patterns, and CLEAR evaluation methodology.
