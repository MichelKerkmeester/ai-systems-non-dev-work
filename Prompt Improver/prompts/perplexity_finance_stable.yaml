        Using [[CENTRAL_BANKS]], [[INFLATION]], [[GROWTH]], [[GOLD_DRIVERS]], 
        [[CURRENCY]], [[RISK_REGIME]], and [[FORWARD_CATALYSTS]]:
        
        1. RATE-EQUITY RELATIONSHIP:
           - Is rate direction supportive or headwind for equities?
           - Real rate impact on VWCE multiples?
           
        2. US vs NON-US DIVERGENCE:
           - Fed vs ECB/BOJ policy divergence
           - Growth differential US vs RoW
           - Currency tailwind/headwind for XDWL
           
        3. GOLD ALLOCATION SIGNAL:
           - Real rate direction (negative = gold positive)
           - Risk regime (stress = gold positive)
           - Central bank buying trend
           
        4. CORRELATION ASSESSMENT:
           - Are VWCE and IGLN providing diversification?
           - Stress correlation (do they diverge in selloffs?)
           
        5. CONVICTION SCORING:
           - HIGH: Multiple primary sources, clear directional signal
           - MEDIUM: Mixed signals or secondary sources
           - LOW: Tertiary sources or conflicting data
