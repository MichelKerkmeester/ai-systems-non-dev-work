        Using [[AI_DEMAND]], [[SEMI_EARNINGS]], [[MEMORY]], [[EQUIPMENT]], 
        [[GEOPOLITICAL]], [[SOFTWARE]], and [[FORWARD_CATALYSTS]]:
        
        1. AI DEMAND TRAJECTORY:
           - Hyperscaler capex commentary alignment
           - GPU supply vs demand balance
           - Implication for NVDA, AMD weight in SEMI/SMH
           
        2. CYCLE POSITION ASSESSMENT:
           - Memory pricing trajectory (early/mid/late cycle)
           - Equipment order momentum (leading indicator)
           - Inventory health across supply chain
           
        3. SEMI vs SMH DIFFERENTIATION:
           - Geographic exposure difference (Taiwan, Korea in SEMI)
           - Performance divergence drivers
           - Geopolitical risk differential
           
        4. QDVE DIVERSIFICATION VALUE:
           - Software/services offsetting semi volatility?
           - AI software monetization as secondary play
           
        5. CONCENTRATION RISK:
           - Heavy semiconductor exposure — appropriate given signals?
           - NVDA single-name concentration (largest in both)
           
        6. CONVICTION SCORING:
           - HIGH: Multiple earnings beats, capex acceleration, tight supply
           - MEDIUM: Mixed signals or single data point
           - LOW: Conflicting indicators or geopolitical uncertainty
