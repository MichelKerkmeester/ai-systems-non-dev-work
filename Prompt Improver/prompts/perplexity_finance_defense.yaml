    Q4_prime_vs_tech_rotation:
      instruction: |
        Analyze the rotation dynamics between traditional defense and defense tech:
        1. **Prime Momentum:** Are traditional defense primes (DFEN) winning major platform contracts?
        2. **Tech Disruption:** Are non-traditional contractors (ARMR) gaining share via OTA/Replicator?
        3. **Budget Signals:** Are defense budgets favoring traditional platforms or next-gen tech?
      output_slot: "[[ROTATION_ANALYSIS]]"
      synthesis_rules:
      - "Tag each item as: Prime Momentum / Tech Disruption / Budget Signal."
      - "Require at least one contract/award datapoint per tag."
      - "Discard items without timestamps inside 72h unless official release/filing referenced by fresh coverage."

    Q5_portfolio_action:
      instruction: |
        Based on the data, determine the 14-day outlook for the defense portfolio:
        - **DFEN (Primes):** Is the industrial backlog growing? (>$100M awards preferred)
        - **ARMR (Tech):** Is risk-on sentiment holding? (program wins + funding/valuation signals)
        - **Rotation:** Should weight shift between primes and tech?
