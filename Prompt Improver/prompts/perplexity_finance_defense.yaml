    Q5_rotation_analysis:
      instruction: |
        SYNTHESIZE from [[EU_PRIME_INTEL]], [[US_PRIME_INTEL]], [[DEFTECH_INTEL]]:

        1. PRIME MOMENTUM
           - Major platform contract wins (tanks, aircraft, missiles)
           - Backlog growth indicators
           - Production ramp signals

        2. TECH DISRUPTION
           - Non-traditional contractor wins
           - OTA/Replicator program selections
           - VC activity in defense tech

        3. BUDGET SIGNALS
           - Spending favoring traditional vs next-gen
           - EU defense budget trajectory
           - US appropriations status

        TAG each finding: [PRIME_WIN] | [TECH_WIN] | [BUDGET_SHIFT]

        DETERMINE: Is momentum favoring DFEN (Primes) or ARMR (Tech)?

    Q6_portfolio_outlook:
      instruction: |
        SYNTHESIZE all Phase 1 outputs into 14-day tactical outlook:

        For EACH holding, determine:
        - STANCE: BUY / HOLD / TRIM
        - CONVICTION: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
        - KEY DRIVER: One-sentence rationale

        Holdings: DFEN.DE, ARMR.MI

        Apply rules:
        - BUY requires contract catalyst or geopolitical escalation
        - TRIM requires budget headwind or program cancellation
        - Consider rotation between Prime and Tech exposure
