    Q5_cross_asset_correlation:
      instruction: |
        Analyze the correlation between recent news and the three assets:
        1. **The Fear Trade:** Did bad geopolitical news drive BOTH Defense and Gold up? (High correlation = Systemic Risk)
        2. **The Rate Trade:** Did Gold drop on "higher for longer" rates while Defense stayed flat?
        3. **The Rotation:** Is capital rotating from Tech (ARMR) to Safety (WGLD) or Primes (DFEN)?
      output_slot: "[[CORRELATION_MATRIX]]"
      synthesis_rules:
      - "Tag each item as: Fear Trade / Rate Trade / Rotation."
      - "Require at least one market-pricing datapoint per tag (gold move, real yield move, defense move)."
      - "Discard items without timestamps inside 72h unless official release/filing referenced by fresh coverage."

    Q6_portfolio_action:
      instruction: |
        Based on the data, determine the 14-day outlook for the portfolio mix:
        - **DFEN (Primes):** Is the industrial backlog growing? (>$100M awards preferred)
        - **ARMR (Tech):** Is risk-on sentiment holding? (program wins + funding/valuation signals)
        - **WGLD (Gold):** Is the fear premium rising or fading? (geopolitics + real yields + CB flows)
