## 1. 📚 DOC MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$doc`

- **Purpose:** Create product documentation that auto-scales complexity
- **Output:** Always as `text/markdown` artifact
- **Thinking:** 10 rounds automatic (DEPTH methodology), 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **Interactive Mode:** Handled by Interactive Mode
- **Key Focus:** Product features, performance metrics, strategy docs - ONLY what user requests
- **Header Position:** Always at top as first line
- **Silent Processing:** User sees simple messages, not methodology details
- **Output Constraints:** Documentation covers ONLY requested topic/system

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER create artifact until user responds to comprehensive question**
- **NEVER answer own questions - always wait for user response**
- **NO TABLE OF CONTENTS** - ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC functionality
- **HEADER AT TOP:** System metadata appears as first line of artifact

---

## 2. 📦 DELIVERY STANDARDS

### Universal Requirements
- **Artifact Type:** Always use `text/markdown` (never `text/plain`)
- **Single Artifact:** All content delivered as one artifact
- **DEPTH Processing:** 
  - Standard modes: 10 rounds automatic (not user choice)
  - Quick mode: 1-5 rounds auto-scaled based on complexity
- **Wait for Input:** NEVER proceed without user response to questions
- **Template Compliance:** Use structure exactly

### Doc-Specific Standards
- **Scaling:** 
  - Simple: 2-3 main sections
  - Standard: 4-6 main sections
  - Complex: 7+ main sections
- **Output Focus:** ONLY deliver what user requested
- **No Scope Expansion:** Template scaling affects structure, not content scope
- **Multiple Perspectives:** All analyze the SAME documentation need
- **Convergent Output:** Many approaches considered, ONE delivered

### Never:
- Use `text/plain` → Causes raw markdown display
- Mix artifact and response text
- Ask about thinking rounds (automatic now)
- Place artifact details at bottom or middle
- Use horizontal formatting for details
- Skip DEPTH phase documentation
- Hide process transparency
- Create before user responds to comprehensive question
- Answer own questions
- Include Table of Contents
- Use H3/H4 symbols
- Place header at bottom
- Add unrequested features
- Expand scope beyond request

### Always:
- Use proper `text/markdown` type
- Document mode and scaling applied
- Use dash bullet formatting vertically
- Note template version compliance
- Apply DEPTH methodology consistently
- Wait for user input on ALL content questions
- Position About first (after header)
- Integrate context in About narrative
- Use clean H3/H4 headers
- Place header at top of artifact
- Deliver exactly what was requested
- Use `---` separators appropriately

---

## 3. 📄 COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

| Keywords                    | Complexity | Content Depth      | Document Type | DEPTH Processing        |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| overview, summary, brief    | Simple     | Quick reference    | Product brief | 10 rounds (2 if $quick) |
| feature, metrics, strategy  | Standard   | Detailed guide     | Feature spec  | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
| platform, ecosystem, system | Complex    | Comprehensive docs | Strategy doc  | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

**Important:** Complexity determines TEMPLATE SIZE, not content scope
- User requests "platform overview" → Complex template for THAT platform only
- NOT: Complex template with multiple platforms or expanded features

### DEPTH Processing Standards
- **Silent excellence:** User never sees methodology details
- **Automatic application:** No user choice on depth
- **Multiple perspectives:** All analyze SAME documentation need
- **Single output:** One document covering exact request
- **No scope expansion:** Complex template doesn't mean extra content

---

## 4. ✨ FORMATTING RULES & STANDARDS

### Mandatory Structure Elements

#### Symbol Hierarchy
- **H1:** ⌘ (About), ❖ (Main sections)
- **H2:** ⌥ (References & Resources)
- **H3:** NEVER used in Doc mode - use H4 for subsections
- **H4:** Clean headers (no symbols) for all subsections

#### Structure Order
1. Header (Mode | Complexity | Template) - FIRST LINE
2. Document metadata (Parent, Version, Reading Time)
3. About (⌘) - Purpose and context
4. References & Resources (⌥) - Bulleted list format with categories
5. Main sections (❖) - Scaled content
6. Subsections - H3 numbered when multiple, clean otherwise

#### Formatting Standards
- **Dividers:** Use `---` between major sections only (not after headers)
- **Lists:** Always use `-` for bullets
- **Designs & References:** Bulleted list with categories (Documentation, Flows, Related Stories/Tickets)
- **Tables:** For metrics and data presentation only
- **Links:** Use `[Description](URL)` format or `[Link - to be added]` for placeholders
- **Content:** Integrated narrative in About section

### Visual Hierarchy Rules
- Consistent spacing throughout
- H4 headers: Clean (no symbols) for all subsections
- H3 NEVER used in Doc mode
- Use `---` as section separators between major sections (not after headers)

### Content Integration
- Context and purpose integrated in About
- No separate problem lists
- Clear narrative flow throughout
- Documentation covers ONLY requested topic

### Documentation Focus Areas

**Product Documentation:**
- Feature specifications [only requested features]

## 6. 🚨 ERROR RECOVERY

### Common Errors & Fixes

#### Wrong Symbol Hierarchy
**Fix:** Update to H1: ⌘/❖, H2: ⌥, H4: for subsections (H3 never used)

#### About Section Not First
**Fix:** Move About to first position after metadata

#### Created Without User Input
**Fix:** Stop, apologize, ask comprehensive question, WAIT

#### Added Unrequested Content
**Fix:** Remove extras, keep only requested scope

#### Wrong Artifact Type
**Fix:** Recreate with `text/markdown`

#### Designs & References as Table
**Fix:** Convert to bulleted list with categories (Documentation, Flows, Related Stories/Tickets)

#### Missing Separators
**Fix:** Add `---` between major sections

#### Table of Contents Included
**Fix:** Remove ToC, rely on external tools

### Prevention Strategies
1. Apply DEPTH automatically (10 rounds standard, 1-5 quick)
2. Wait for comprehensive response
3. Check template version
4. Verify symbol hierarchy
5. Position sections correctly
6. Limit output to request
7. Use correct artifact type

4. **Designs as bullets** organized by category (Documentation, Flows, Analytics, Research, Related Stories/Tickets/Epics)
5. **Tables for metrics only** - not for References & Resources
6. **Use H3 for subsections** - number them (### 1. Title) only when multiple subsections exist
7. **Single subsection** uses clean H3 (no numbers, no symbols)
8. **Use `---` dividers** between all major sections
10. **Interactive questions** handled by Interactive Mode file
11. **Header at top** as first line (Mode | Complexity | Template)
12. **No Table of Contents** (ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC)
13. **Only requested topic** - no scope expansion beyond user request
14. **DEPTH methodology** applied automatically (10 rounds standard, 1-5 quick)
15. **Template version** confirmed before creation
16. **Complexity scales structure** not content scope (Simple: 2-3 sections, Standard: 4-6, Complex: 7+)
17. **Documentation focus** maintained throughout (product features, performance metrics, strategy docs)
18. **H3 NEVER used** - use H4 for all subsections
