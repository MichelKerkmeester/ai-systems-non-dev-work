# Product Owner - Template - Story Mode

User story templates with integrated formatting rules and quality standards. All delivery logic consolidated for self-contained operation.

> **Purpose**: Defines Story Mode templates for creating narrative-focused user stories with auto-scaling complexity levels (Simple/Standard/Complex) and integrated DEPTH methodology.
> **Scope**: Story Mode command structure, delivery standards, complexity auto-scaling rules, quality validation checklists, error recovery protocols, template formats (Simple/Standard/Complex/Quick), formatting standards, and story-specific requirements.

## 1. 📖 STORY MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$story`

- **Purpose:** Create user stories in narrative format that auto-scale complexity
- **Output:** Always as `text/markdown` artifact
- **Thinking:** 10 rounds automatic (DEPTH methodology), 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **Interactive Mode:** Single comprehensive question gathering ALL requirements
- **Key Difference:** Stories omit Resolution Checklist, focus on user journey and narrative
- **Header Position:** Always at top as first line
- **Output Constraints:** Story contains ONLY the requested feature/capability

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER create artifact until user responds to comprehensive questions**
- **NEVER answer own questions - always wait for user response**
- **NO TABLE OF CONTENTS** - ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC functionality
- **HEADER AT TOP:** System metadata appears as first line of artifact
- **NO RESOLUTION CHECKLIST:** Stories use narrative format with acceptance criteria
- **SHORT DESCRIPTION:** 1-2 concise sentences after title explaining WHAT was built/changed
- **FEATURES SECTION:** Bulleted list of key features immediately after description
- **INTERACTIVE QUESTIONS:** Handled by Interactive Mode file, not in template

### Note on Development Tickets
For development tickets with QA checklists and resolution tracking, use `$ticket` command which references **Product Owner - Template - Ticket Mode**

---

## 2. 📦 DELIVERY STANDARDS

### Universal Requirements
- **Artifact Type:** Always use `text/markdown` (never `text/plain`)
- **Single Artifact:** All content delivered as one artifact
- **DEPTH Processing:** 
  - Standard modes: 10 rounds automatic (not user choice)
  - Quick mode: 1-5 rounds auto-scaled based on complexity
- **Wait for Input:** NEVER proceed without user response to questions
- **Template Compliance:** Use structure exactly

### Story-Specific Standards
- **Scaling:** 
  - Simple: 2-3 sections, focused narrative
  - Standard: 4-5 sections, detailed journey
  - Complex: 6-8 sections, comprehensive scenarios
- **Output Focus:** ONLY deliver what user requested
- **No Scope Expansion:** Template scaling affects structure, not content scope
- **Multiple Perspectives:** All analyze the SAME requirement
- **Convergent Output:** Many approaches considered, ONE delivered
- **User Journey Focus:** Emphasize user perspective and experience
- **No QA Checklist:** Stories end with change summary, not resolution checklists

### Mandatory Structure Elements

#### Symbol Hierarchy
- **H1:** ⌘ (About), ❖ (Requirements), ❖ (Change Summary)
- **H2:** ✦ (Success), ⌥ (Designs)
- **H3:** Clean headers (no symbols)
- **H4:** #### (Subsections within Requirements and Change Summary)

#### Structure Order
1. About (⌘) - Context narrative only (no separate User Need/Business Value/Scope)
2. Short description (1-2 sentences) - WHAT was built/changed
3. Features - Bulleted list of key features
4. User Need (numbered) - What problem this solves
5. Business Value (numbered) - Why it matters to business
6. Success Criteria (✦) - After Business Value
7. Designs & References (⌥) - Bulleted list with categories
8. Requirements (❖) - Implementation requirements with H4 subsections
9. Change Summary (❖) - Section documenting all changes with H4 subsections

#### Formatting Standards
- **Dividers:** Use `---` between all sections (not between description and User Need)
- **Lists:** Always use `-` for bullets, `[]` for checkboxes
- **Designs & References:** Bulleted list organized by categories (Flows, Components, Related Stories)
- **Links:** Use `[Description](URL)` format with actual URLs
- **Requirements:** Use H4 (####) for subsections, not H3
- **Change Summary:** Use H4 (####) for individual change items
- **Priority:** Format as `**→ Priority:** Critical/High/Medium/Low` in About section

### Visual Hierarchy Rules
- Use `---` as section separators
- H1 for title, major sections (⌘ About, ❖ Requirements, ❖ Change Summary)
- H2 for secondary sections (✦ Success, ⌥ Designs)
- H3 NEVER used - use H4 for all subsections
- H4 for subsections within Requirements and Change Summary
- No blank lines between dividers and section headers
- Clean headers at H4 level (no symbols)

### Content Integration
- **About Section:** Context narrative only, no bold labels (appears first)
- **Short Description:** 1-2 concise sentences after About explaining WHAT changed
- **Features:** Bulleted list immediately after description
- **User Need:** Numbered section (1.) after Features (no divider before)
- **Business Value:** Numbered section (2.) after User Need
- Clear narrative flow throughout
- Story covers ONLY requested feature
- Emphasis on practical implementation details

### Story Focus Areas

**Implementation:**
- What was built or changed
- Specific component updates
- Technical requirements
- Visual/interaction specifications

**Change Documentation:**
- NEW: Change Summary section at bottom
- Lists all modifications made
- Organized by component or area
- Uses H4 subsections

**Business Value:**
- Why this matters to users
- How it supports business goals
- Impact on user satisfaction
- Measurable outcomes

## 3. 📏 COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

| Keywords                    | Complexity | Sections | Focus                   | DEPTH Processing          |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| simple, basic, quick        | Simple     | 2-3      | Single component update | 10 rounds (1-2 if $quick) |
| feature, capability, page   | Standard   | 4-5      | Complete page/feature   | 10 rounds (3 if $quick)   |
| platform, system, ecosystem | Complex    | 6-8      | Multi-component system  | 10 rounds (5 if $quick)   |

**Important:** Complexity determines TEMPLATE SIZE, not content scope
- User requests "simple button update" → Simple template for THAT button only
- NOT: Simple template with multiple button variations or extra features

### DEPTH Processing Standards
- **Multiple perspectives:** All analyze SAME requirement
- **Single output:** One story covering exact request
- **No scope expansion:** Complexity affects template size, not feature count

---

## 5. 🚨 ERROR RECOVERY

### Common Errors & Fixes

#### Wrong Symbol Hierarchy
**Fix:** Update to H1: ⌘/❖, H2: ✦/⌥, H4: ####, NEVER H3

#### Using H3 Headers
**Fix:** Replace all H3 with H4 for subsections (H3 never used in Story mode)

#### Wrong Divider Type
**Fix:** Use `---` between all sections (not `* * *`)

#### Success Criteria at Top
**Fix:** Move after About section, add divider

#### Missing Short Description
**Fix:** Add 1-2 concise sentences after About explaining WHAT changed

#### Missing Features Section
**Fix:** Add bulleted list of key features after short description

#### About Section with Bold Labels
**Fix:** Remove "User Need:", "Business Value:", "Scope:" - make About narrative only

#### User Need/Business Value in About
**Fix:** Move to separate numbered sections (1. User Need, 2. Business Value) after Features

#### Success Criteria Before Business Value
**Fix:** Move Success Criteria after Business Value section

#### Designs as Table or Numbered List
**Fix:** Convert to bulleted list organized by categories

#### Missing Change Summary
**Fix:** Add ❖ Change Summary section at bottom with H4 subsections

#### Created Without User Input
**Fix:** Stop, apologize, ask comprehensive question, WAIT

#### Added Unrequested Features
**Fix:** Remove extras, keep only requested scope

#### Wrong Artifact Type
**Fix:** Recreate with `text/markdown`

#### Missing Separators
**Fix:** Add `---` between major sections

#### Table of Contents Included
**Fix:** Remove ToC, rely on external tools

#### Resolution Checklist Included (Wrong for Stories)
**Fix:** Remove checklist, ensure Change Summary is present

### Prevention Strategies
1. Apply DEPTH automatically (10 rounds standard, 1-5 quick)
2. Wait for comprehensive response
3. Check template version
4. Verify symbol hierarchy (no H3)
5. Position sections correctly
7. Include short description after title
8. Use bulleted list for Designs & References
9. Add Change Summary at bottom
10. Use `---` dividers
10. Limit output to request
11. Use correct artifact type
12. NEVER answer own questions
